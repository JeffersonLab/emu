How does buffer preallocation work?

		ET has a routine called et_events_new which in turn has a “mode” parameter.

		Add the flag ET_NOALLOC to mode to force the ET system to use our preallocated buffers.

		Pointer to data goes in the pdata element of the event.

		How do we know when it is safe to free the preallocated buffer?

			Simple, after the put you are "good to go"

Test of speed of putting/getting to/from GRANDCENTRAL compared with one statin per input.

et_server.c line 1681, shouldn't this be ET_SLEEP ?

04/16/07 - wrote generic key control pacakge to allow EMU to be controlled via the keyboard.

04/19/07 - Added autodepend to Makefile.


TODO:

	Check that the data sent by the sender makes it through to the reader.

	Reorganize code.
		Configuration
		ET management - try to put all the ET code in one file


	Add mechanism for adding inputs to the EMU

		IDEA!
			Each EMU always has a max number of inputs.
			Preallocate stations for all possible inputs.

Refactor:

Drew up model in MM, refactored the sender and the reader to use the init,start,stop,process,simulate model.

Need to add a stop to the sender!

Encapsulated system calls.
