How does buffer preallocation work?

		ET has a routine called et_events_new which in turn has a “mode” parameter.

		Add the flag ET_NOALLOC to mode to force the ET system to use our preallocated buffers.

		Pointer to data goes in the pdata element of the event.

		How do we know when it is safe to free the preallocated buffer?

			Simple, after the put you are "good to go"

et_server.c line 1681, shouldn't this be ET_SLEEP ?
