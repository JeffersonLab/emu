Changes from the previous version:

Version 2.3
    - fix major bug in ER in which use of ByteBuffer backing events is released for
      reuse BEFORE all events written to file, resulting in corrupted data.
    - make EB multithreaded
    - add ability to flush events through emu every 2 seconds if data rate is low
    - add fake Trigger Supervisor to handle fake ROCs
    - add flag to scripts forcing use of IPv4
    - add emu config option to set preferred ET communication subnet
    - make ET event handling more efficient

Version 2.4
    - simplify setting (error) state of emu.
      Eliminate internal polling of channels, transports, and modules for errors to determine
      state. Have them report an error when it occurs. Eliminate unnecessary locks when
      finding state and reporting errors/stats.
      Have reset shut down ability for chan, trans, mods to change state.
    - add RESETTING state
    - add cmsgpassword to cMsg client UDLs in emu's communication with platform cMsg server
    - fix bug in quitting EB's build threads
    - get emu domain working with new protocol and preferred subnet

Version 2.5
    - Compatible with et-16.0
    - ER input channels do not parse beyond first bank header
    - Channels handle user events coming right after prestart
    - Remove code handling more than one type of ring item.
      Use compact evio structures only instead of that and EvioEvent objects.
    - correctly handle an event designated as the "first event" to be identified
      by the output file channel and passed to the EventWriter so it can be
      written as the first event in each file split.

Version 2.6
    - ByteBufferSupply class no longer requires use of synchronized code if
      user specifies option to release ByteBufferItems in same order as acquired.
    - Emu input channel now uses ByteBufferSupply without synchronization and
      EB now ensures those buffers are released in order.
    - fake ROC can operate without output channel
    - EB now has a resource-freeing thread which cleans up after build threads.
      Build thread optimized if only 1.
    - Emu domain server no longer kills off other domain servers at the same
      EXPID and port. Each server can ignore multicasts from components of the
      wrong name. Thus multiple sessions can coexist with domain servers of the
      same port & EXPID if they serve different components.
      This requires emu domain UDL to contain component name and there's a
      communication protocol change - hence the new version number.
    - fix bug in which user event processing can change the endian order of the
      whole backing buffer (and therefore the events to be built). Happens when
      input data in opposite endian as module output.
    - fix bug in which EB releases user event buffer more than once.
